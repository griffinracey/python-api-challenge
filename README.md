Challenge Assignment 6 - Python API

For WeatherPy, my primary resources for fetching the data were the OpenWeatherMap API Documentation (primarily for the url paramters) and the activities from Day 2 of the API unit which were mostly just using the requests.get to fetch data.

For VacationPy, I referenced Activity 6 from Day 3 for help with plotting the maps. I also used the documentation for hvplot for geographic data for help with parameters.

For the iterations, I used Activity 4 from Day 3. I also used the Geoapify documentation for the category name (accomodation.hotel), to fill out filter and bias, and to use the correct parameter names.
